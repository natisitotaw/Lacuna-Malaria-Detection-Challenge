# Lacuna Malaria Detection Challenge

## Todo:
- Build a custom object detection model.
- Develop a classification model for the detected objects.
- Preprocess and annotate the dataset for training.
- Fine-tune the object detection model for accuracy.
- Evaluate performance using standard metrics (e.g., mAP, precision, recall).
- Optimize the classification model for speed and accuracy.
- Test the end-to-end pipeline on unseen data.
- Document the results and findings.
